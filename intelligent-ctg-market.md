<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Intelligent CTG Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>External Cardiotocography</li><li>Internal Cardiotocography</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The Intelligent CTG market is divided into two main types: external and internal cardiotocography. External cardiotocography uses sensors placed on the motherâ€™s abdomen to monitor fetal heart rate and uterine contractions non-invasively. It is widely used for routine checks and in labor wards. In contrast, internal cardiotocography involves placing a fetal scalp electrode and intrauterine pressure catheter to obtain more accurate readings, particularly in high-risk pregnancies or when closer monitoring is necessary during labor. Both methods aim to enhance fetal monitoring and improve outcomes.</p></p>
