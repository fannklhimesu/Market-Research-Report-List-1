<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Truck Tires Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Diagonal Tires</li><li>Radial Tires</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The truck tire market primarily consists of two types: diagonal tires and radial tires. Diagonal tires, also known as bias-ply tires, feature layers of fabric arranged diagonally, providing robust construction for heavy loads but limited flexibility. In contrast, radial tires have layers arranged perpendicular to the tread, offering superior traction, fuel efficiency, and longevity. The shift towards radial tires is driven by their better performance characteristics, making them increasingly popular among fleet operators and long-haul transport services.</p></p>
