<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Semiconductor Chiller Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Water Cooled</li><li>Air Cooled</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The semiconductor chiller market comprises two primary types: water-cooled and air-cooled chillers. Water-cooled chillers utilize water as a heat exchange medium, providing efficient cooling, especially in large facilities. They are typically more effective for high-capacity operations but require a cooling tower and water supply. In contrast, air-cooled chillers use ambient air for cooling, making them easier to install and requiring less maintenance. However, they may be less efficient in high-temperature environments and are generally suitable for smaller applications.</p></p>
